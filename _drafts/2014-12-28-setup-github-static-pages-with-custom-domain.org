Below I will describe the steps I took to setup GitHub static pages
with my own domain name.

** setup a CNAME on GitHub
   - create a file named =CNAME=
   - put your domain name in there

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     example.com
   #+END_SRC

** setup CloudFlare
   - redirect you Domain to your GitHub Address

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <img src=/assets/article_images/screenshot-cloudflare.png />
   #+END_HTML

   - don't forget to transfer your DNS to Cloudflare
