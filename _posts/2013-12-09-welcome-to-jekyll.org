#+title:  Welcome to Jekyll! (with Org mode features!)
#+date:   2013-12-09
#+layout: post

You'll find this post in your ~_posts~ directory - edit this post and
re-build (or run with the ~-w~ switch) to see your changes!  To add
new posts, simply add a file in the ~_posts~ directory that follows
the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

#+begin_src ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
#+end_src
